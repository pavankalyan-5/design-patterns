#### 🏗️ **Problem Statement**

Imagine you are building an online meal ordering platform for a fast-food restaurant. Customers want to customize their meals:
- Choose a burger 🍔, pizza 🍕, or salad 🥗 as the main dish
- Add sides like fries 🍟, nuggets 🍗, or a healthy fruit cup 🍎
- Pick a drink 🥤 (size, flavor, ice level)
- Optionally add desserts 🍰 or extra toppings 🧀

Each meal can be built in countless ways, and not every customer wants every option. Using traditional constructors quickly becomes confusing and hard to maintain as options grow. You need a way to let users build their perfect meal step by step, ensuring every order is valid and easy to extend with new options in the future.
